# AerolÃ­nea PanAmerica

This is a fake travel website for Spanish language learners.

I built it with React, based on Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v5](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5) course for [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/). This was overkill, but I needed to learn React for work.

## Prerequisites

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

Open this project in VS Code. Launch a new terminal, and run

```
$ npm install

```

Some helpful VSCode extensions:

- ESLint

- Azure App Service
- Prettier (File -> Preferences -> Settings, enable 'Format on Save' and 'Prettier: Require Config')
