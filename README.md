# Aerolinea PanAmericana
This is a fake travel website for Spanish language learners.  

I built it with React, based on Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v5](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5) course for [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/). This was overkill, but I needed to learn React for work.  

To run it, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.  

Open a terminal (either in VSCode or PowerShell), cd into the project root, and run 'npm run dev'
