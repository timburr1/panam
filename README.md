# AerolÃ­nea PanAmerica

This is a fake travel website for Spanish language learners.

I built it with React, based on Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v5](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5) course for [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/). This was overkill, but I needed to learn React for work.

To run it, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code or using PowerShell, cd into the project root, and run 'npm run dev'.

VSCode addons:

- ESLint
- npm Intellisense
- Azure App Service
- Prettier: File -> Preferences -> Settings, enable 'Format on Save' and 'Prettier: Require Config'
